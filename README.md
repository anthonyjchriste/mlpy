# mlpy-isla
Fork of mlpy at http://mlpy.sourceforge.net/ so that we can upload the latest versions to Pypi.

mlpy is a machine learning library that contains algorithms for CWT. It has not been updated since 2012 and the latest version is not in the pip repos. This fork aims to fix those issues so that scientists can continue to use mlpy by installing it through pip.
